# beaglebone-HTTP-GPIO
Provides access to beaglebone GPIO directly via HTTP.
Offers maximal flexibility but minimal security.

# To Do
* Come up with a better way to configure IO, currently all active pins have to be hard coded into the server script.
* Finish integrating the "simulator.html" template, originally provided in the OOB files.
